In 2008 he hit the mark with his career changing single <em>Black &amp; Gold</em> which received critical acclaim and shot to No.2 in the UK, No.4 in Australia and top 20 in 14 countries.&nbsp; Sam&rsquo;s sophomore release, <em>Return to Paradise</em> was a play on nostalgia and &ldquo;paradise garage&rdquo; &ndash; a genre derived from the discotheque scene in New York in the late 70s, famous for its unique and eclectic style of disco and dance music.&nbsp; In 2013 Sparro released <em>Quantum Physical: Volume One</em>, which finds Sam digging into both his 1990&rsquo;s and current 12&rdquo; Vinyl collection for sonic stimulus, while lyrically addressing issues we&rsquo;re seeing in our day to day lives all over the world. He&#39;s toured with the likes of Adele and Robyn, and headlined his own tour playing festivals around the world including Glastonbury and Coachella.</p><p>\t<strong>Ultra Nat&eacute;</strong> has remained a musical chameleon, embracing a variety of sounds, from R&amp;B/hip-hop, soul and disco to house, rock and electro-pop 25 years after sashaying onto international dance floors. In 1998 Ultra released the anthem &quot;Free&quot; which became an international platinum selling single and has become a dance classic. Shortly after in 1999 her smash rework of &quot;If You Could Read My Mind&quot; with Jocelyn Enriquez &amp; Amber saw Ultra in the Studio 54 soundtrack and followed the crossover success. In 2013 Ultra released her eighth studio album &quot;Hero Worship&quot; featuring collaborations with a list of who&#39;s who in dance music - showing she&#39;s always had her finger on the pulse. A humble, hardworking legend, today Ultra continues to record tirelessly and evolve as an artist who is also songwriter, producer, DJ, label owner, club promoter and live performer - a highly sought-after darling of the international dance scene.</p><p>\tLegendary drag icon <strong>Kevin Aviance</strong>, who&#39;s a member of the House of Aviance, became an underground sensation in the late-&#39;90s gay dance scene, releasing # 1 Billboard dance hits and taking his drag show on the road. Inspired largely by Grace Jones, though also citing Boy George as an influence, Aviance made a name for himself primarily in New York&#39;s thriving gay scene, affiliating himself with other dance icons like Junior Vasquez, Tony Moran, Victor Calderone and the late Peter Rauhofer. It wasn&#39;t long before novelty tracks like &quot;Cunty,&quot; an aggressive update of &quot;Din Da Da,&quot; the S&amp;M-tinged &quot;Rhythm Is My Bitch&quot; and &quot;Alive&quot; which become popular club anthems that allowed him to perform throughout North America, Europe and Asia.</p><p>\tStyle, sophistication, and soul.

They&rsquo;ve been compared to sister acts of old and Appalachian family groups, yet their original songs and arrangements have a very contemporary aspect, with elements of pop, blues, folk, and even psychedelic rock. Abigail and Lily were born in Brooklyn New York. They couldn&rsquo;t help but pick up a thorough grounding in traditional American roots music and folk-rock from their father, 3-time Grammy Award winning singer-songwriter Tom Chapin. He, along with their grandfather Jim Chapin, a jazz drummer, and their uncle, singer-songwriter Harry Chapin, created an environment wherein music held an almost sacred purpose, of bringing people together, whether it be for family, humanitarian purposes, or joyful release.&nbsp; When the family relocated to New York&rsquo;s Hudson Valley, the girls attended a Waldorf school whose arts-based education added training in orchestral music and the complicated harmonies of Shape-note songs and old English folk ballads. Through elementary and high school they sang on over a dozen studio albums. With two critically-acclaimed full-length albums under their belt, 2008&rsquo;s Lake Bottom LP and 2010&rsquo;s Two, Abigail and Lily released A Date with the Everly Brothers in the Spring of 2013. Recorded in one day, live in the studio with a full band in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, the album includes 14 of the sisters&rsquo; favorite Everlys songs, a tribute as well as a master class in harmony singing. The album was featured on NPR&rsquo;s Weekend Edition, The New York Times&rsquo; T magazine, and included on many year-end top 10 lists. The Chapin Sisters are currently working on their next album.</p><p>", "<a href=\"\"http://www.hypnoticbrassensemble.com/\"\"><strong>Hypnotic Brass Ensemble</strong></a> is a family of 8 blood brothers, sons of jazz trumpeter/composer Phil Cohran (Sun Ra, co-founder of AACM, mentor to EARTH WIND &amp; FIRE), who were raised on the south-side of Chicago under the rigorous training methods their musically talented parents. From an early age it was clear the brothers of Hypnotic were born for the stage, they grew at the feet of music giants such as Louis Satterfield, Sun Ra, &amp; Pete Cosey while at the same time performing as children along with father at local showcases. By 1999, a few of the older members returned from music scholarships at college to find their younger brothers playing on the streets of Chicago to rave success. They subsequently formed the Hypnotic Brass Ensemble and after finding a drummer, began to collectively write original tunes in order to create a record with their very own sound &quot;The Flipside&quot;. Initially their only aim was to bring horns and live instrumentation back to mainstream music, but after taking to the streets of United States&#39; major cities HBE enjoyed the independent success of over 65,000 units sold direct to fans and also attracted the attention of Kanye West mentor NO ID. In 2003, Hypnotic cut the horns for his current production &quot;Metal Lungees&quot; that featured on Wu-Tang MC Ghostface Killah&#39;s &quot;Pretty Toney&quot; album for Def Jam Island. At the same time HBE had begun to record &amp; self-produce their sophomore effort &quot;Jupiter&quot;, and when a Def Jam Records production deal went sour the band moved to NYC to promote and sale their latest project solo.</p><p>", "Born in Oakland, CA, as a music-hungry youngster, <strong>Craig Handy</strong> experimented on guitar, trombone, and piano before settling on his first true love, the saxophone. His distinctive sound and authentic instrumental prowess were immediately noticed by artists of stature. Handy moved to New York in 1986 and began several associations with formidable&nbsp; artists including Herbie Hancock, Dee Dee Bridgewater, &nbsp;master drummers Art Blakey and Roy Haynes, South African melodist Abdullah Ibrahim, and the Mingus Dynasty Band. For the past several years, Handy has recorded or toured consistently with guitarist John Scofield, trumpeter Charles Tolliver, the John Hicks Legacy Band, and most notably The Cookers - a collective of stalwart leaders renowned for playing that simmers or surges to a boiling point - with brethren Billy Harper, George Cables, Eddie Henderson, Billy Hart, Cecil McBee, and David Weiss. In 2014, Handy returns as an original bandleader and party-starter for his new touring and recording project. Titled Craig&nbsp; Handy &amp; 2nd Line Smith, Handy draws from his fondness for the music of New Orleans, smack attached to the groove-filled re-imaginings of originals and standards by the late, great organist&nbsp; Jimmy Smith. The release includes cameos by Dee Dee Bridgewater and Wynton Marsalis while filling a rotating drum chair with Jason Marsalis, Herlin Riley, Ali Jackson, and Steve Williams. But the band at the core of the recording springs out of Handy&rsquo;s current residence in Weehawken, NJ, and shines a light on organist Kyle Koehler, guitarist Matt Chertkoff, and sousaphonist Clark Gayton.&nbsp;</p><p>", "<strong><a href=\"\"http://arbutusrecords.com/\"\">Sean Nicholas Savage </a></strong>is a Canadian Singer and Ballad Composer. In 2013 he released the record Other Life, his most emotionally thematic work and first in a year since he prolifically delivered three full length cassette albums; Flamingo, Won Ton Jaz and Trippple Midnight Karma in 2011. Savage touches always on a theory or profound observation and comes to at least a suggested point in his pop, drama compositions. Perhaps the pinnacle attraction of his work are these observations, learned wisdoms, the ongoing adventures shaping Savage himself, the Artist, the Performer, the Narrator. A pop &lsquo;character&rsquo;, but with severe realness comparable to Punk/Pop greats, such as Sinead O&rsquo;Connor, Boy George or fellow Canadian poetics Majical Cloudz and Mac DeMarco. However, with the way music is consumed today, comparisons of contemporaries fail to do any contemporary justice.

After first performing at an immigrant rights march in New York City in 2006 in front of a half million people, the bilingual crew has taken the international community by storm with their explosive live shows. With influences ranging from Chicago house to South American folk, Rebel Diaz combines classic boom bap tradition with Hip-Hop&rsquo;s global impact. The group&rsquo;s versatility has allowed for them to share the stage with the likes of Common, Mos Def, and Public Enemy, while feeling right at home with acts like Rage Against the Machine and Calle 13. Multiple tours throughout Europe and Latin America have only solidified their international appeal. With roots in Chicago, and now based in the South Bronx, Rebel Diaz has also piqued the interest of the academic community with their poignant social commentary and energetic performances. They have spent the last 8 years visiting dozens of colleges and universities, facilitating workshops, speaking on panels, and performing at national conferences. Building on this growing network of positive young people in Hip-Hop, the group opened a community arts center in the South Bronx in 2008, the Rebel Diaz Arts Collective (RDACBX). On the heels of their critically acclaimed Otro Guerrillero mixtape series, and 2011&prime;s #Occupy The Airwaves mixtape, Rebel Diaz released their debut album, The Radical Dilemma, in December 2013.</p><p>", "According to Will Friedwald at The Wall Street Journal, vocalist <strong>Brianna Thomas</strong> &quot;... may well be the best young straight-ahead jazz singer of her generation.&quot; Thomas was born and raised in Peoria, IL where she first cut her teeth as a performer.&nbsp; Initially taught and influenced by her Father, drummer and vocalist Charlie Thomas, Brianna comes from a rich background of diverse musical influences.&nbsp; Brianna&nbsp; moved to NYC in 2007 to attend college at The New School University and has since established herself as a talented vocalist on the scene today.

Her last release, &quot;Human Again,&quot; debuted at No. 5 on the Billboard album chart (plus No.1 on iTunes). This achievement merely crowned the considerable success Ingrid had already earned with her previous compositions: beautiful, idiosyncratic songs that have been prominently featured in popular films, television and on regular rotation in commercials. Her DIY approach to making music -- composing her own songs, co-releasing albums on her Cabin 24 imprint, building an organic following through music-licensing, and back in her MySpace days (where she was discovered in 2006), promoting herself -- was a slam-dunk. Now, it had evolved into a well-oiled machine, The New York Times even weighed in, declaring her songwriting &quot;smart,&quot; her tunes &quot;irresistible&quot; and her live show &quot;seamless.&quot; Then, says Ingrid, &quot;Everything just came to a screeching halt.&quot; While helping out seriously ill relatives, her dog died. Soon after, Ingrid herself fell sick with serious stomach issues. &quot;My whole throat was on fire for a few months. I had to stop writing,&quot; she says, of the time between April and August 2013. &quot;I was so ill, I couldn&#39;t sing.&quot; After seeing countless doctors -- &quot;like, three a day&quot; at its worst -- she got better and was able to resume writing &quot;Lights Out.&quot; For someone associated with crafting sunny tunes about escapism, a creative detour into dusk seemed almost inevitable. Technically, &quot;Lights Out&quot; refers to the two words uttered on Ingrid&#39;s tour bus when everyone&#39;s ready to call it a night. But given recent developments, it&#39;s become a metaphor for contemplating mortality and letting go -- themes more thoughtful than they are dark. The album builds into intensity, but is anchored by the swelling pop-affirmation &quot;Time Machine&quot; and the sweetly buoyant &quot;Girls Chase Boys,&quot; which fits squarely into her existing catalog. &quot;We thought of that song as the bridge for people. I&#39;m still respecting what people want, but showing them what I can do,&quot; she explains, adding: &quot;Some of the songs, like &#39;Over You,&#39; are written to sound like relationship-y songs, but they&#39;re not.&quot; The ethereal &quot;Handsome Hands&quot; is arguably &quot;Lights Out&quot;&#39;s most left-of-center offering. &quot;The song is about death, but it&#39;s also about the higher power,&quot; she explains. &quot;In moments of desperation, even the most non-religious people pray. When you&#39;re pushed to your limits, you look for help from something other than yourself.&quot; Similarly, &quot;Wonderful Unknown&quot; is a positive, if beguiling narrative about the fears and uncertainties of growing old with your spouse, which she delivers in a lower register. An after-effect of her illness? &quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve lost part of my voice,&quot; she explains, &quot;but my voice has somewhat changed.&quot; Perhaps more dauntingly, &quot;Lights Out&quot; also marks Ingrid&#39;s entry into a brave new world of songwriting. Recorded in New York, Los Angeles, and Nashville, the album features six producers and ten co-writers, including singer-songwriters Katie Herzig and Trent Dabbs, as well as the very in-demand Busbee (Pink, Katy Perry, Lady Antebellum). &quot;With every other record, I&#39;ve always written all of the songs. I&#39;ve worked with one producer. And we&#39;ve stayed in one room,&quot; she says. &quot;I&#39;ve been such a control freak about my songs! But if you can get with the right person, there are ideas you could never come up with. It totally opens doors.&quot; And with opportunity comes meaningful change. &quot;It&#39;s funny. It doesn&#39;t even feel like I wrote &#39;The Way I Am,&#39;&quot; Ingrid says of her platinum break-out single, recorded seven year ago. &quot;It&#39;s a memory.&quot; She&#39;ll continue to perform it live as she tours &quot;Lights Out&quot; -- just stripped-down, recasting the flittering ditty into something weightier. &quot;It feels like a little girl wrote that song.

Nodding to &lsquo;70s rock with shimmering acoustic guitars, an understated rhythm section and flourishes of fiddle, mandolin, piano and dobro, <em>Another Life</em> bridges the mainstream appeal of songwriters like Jesse Harris and Norah Jones and the quirkier sensibility of Loudon Wainwright. With funding entirely from fan contributions through PledgeMusic, Maddock worked with producer Matt Pierson, multi-instrumentalist Larry Campbell (who&rsquo;s played with Bob Dylan and Levon Helm) and bassist Tony Scherr (who plays with Norah Jones). After fronting the Columbia Records band Wood, whose debut <em>Songs From Stamford Hill </em>was featured prominently on TV shows such as &ldquo;Dawson&rsquo;s Creek,&rdquo; Maddock moved from England to New York City in 2003. His 2009 album <em>Sunrise On Avenue C</em> won a New York Music Award for Best Americana Album, while follow-up <em>Wake Up And Dream</em> ranked among the top albums of 2011 in WFUV&#39;s Listener Poll. He has performed with Bruce Springsteen, Willie Nile, Aaron Comess (Spin Doctors) and David Immergluck (Counting Crows). According to radio legend Vin Scelsa, Maddock&#39;s &quot;heartbreakingly beautiful and exquisitely crafted&quot; music &quot;touches the soul.&quot; Maddock is a constant live presence in the U.S. and Europe.</p><p>", "<li>8:00 &ndash; 8:30: Networking</li></ul><p>Please <a href=\"\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/learning-about-nyc-environment-sustainability-tickets-44988175845\"\">register on Eventbrite</a> to attend the event.</p><p>This event is brought to you by the <a href=\"\"https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/\"\" target=\"\"_blank\"\">NYC Open Data Team</a>, <a href=\"\"https://www.esri.com/en-us/home\"\" target=\"\"_blank\"\">Esri</a>, <a href=\"\"https://civichall.org/\"\" target=\"\"_blank\"\">Civic Hall</a> and key City Agency partners: <a href=\"\"https://www.nycgovparks.org/\"\" target=\"\"_blank\"\">NYC Department of Parks &amp; Recreation</a>, <a href=\"\"http://www.nyc.gov/sustainability\"\" target=\"\"_blank\"\">Mayor&#39;s Office of Sustainability</a> and <a href=\"\"http://www.nyc.gov/dep\"\" target=\"\"_blank\"\">NYC Department of Environmental Protection</a>.</p><p>We will also have guest speakers from <a href=\"\"https://www.participatorybudgeting.org/\"\" target=\"\"_blank\"\">Participatory Budgeting Project</a> and New Schools&#39;s <a href=\"\"http://urbansystemslab.com/\"\" target=\"\"_blank\"\">Urban Systems Lab</a>.</p>\"", "Experience the thunderous rhythms of the ancestral Japanese Taiko drums and the magical sounds of the bamboo flutes.&nbsp;Hear and feel the ancestral Taiko drums give thunderous voice to traditional and new compositions.Roughly translated, Taiko means big drums-and that&rsquo;s exactly what Taikoza brings.

He incorporates traces of fingerprints, nails, wires, carvings, and precariously placed boulders as remnant evidence of the sculptures&rsquo; manmade composition and the effect of human interaction with the natural world.
