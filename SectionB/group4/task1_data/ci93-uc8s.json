pre-embedded in the clothing. When a child in B\u00e2\u0080\u0099ZT wanders off, B\u00e2\u0080\u0099zT system issues alarms to prevent any missing child.  After a lost-and-found experience that founder Kiyeon Nam had with her 3-year-old daughter at a shopping center, She was shocked to find that most tracking devices are expensive with monthly subscription plan and uncomfortable. As a mother of two children and a 20-year fashion industry veteran in New York City, she decided to develop a tracking device that is affordable, machine washable, has no battery recharging required, allows group tracking, and works anywhere in the world. In other words, she wanted the most comfortable tracking device in the world. After filing a first patent in 2015, Kiyeon and her team worked hard to bring B'zT to the market where it has already received recognition as one of the top tracking solutions for children.   Most of the tracking devices in the market are expensive with monthly subscription fees, and battery recharging is required. They are easy to loose and uncomfortable to wear especially for young children. In contrast, B'zT's washable tracking device is pre-embedded in a t-shirt. You can machine wash it, you don't need to recharge the battery. There is no subscription fee. B'zT's application of technology is non-intrusive and so simple that you don't even think it's a tracking device. You can treat B'zT just as a regular t-shirt and enjoy all the benefits of the technology.   One of the drawbacks of conventional tracking devices is the fact that they are easy to loose. Between charging and paying monthly fees for maintenance, parents and caregivers gets frustrated when the battery runs out or forgot to charge when you need to use. What if a parent has 5 children to monitor or a teacher has 30 students to track on a field trip? what if a whole entire school wants to monitor children every day in a least intrusive way? What if parent wash tracking device as if it's a regular clothing? Now with B'zT, for the first time in fashion-technology history, we can do this all for our children's safety.   Despite just coming into the market in 2017, B'zT has already received recognition from PC Magazine and others as one of the top tracker solutions for children. B'zT was honored to receive a Female Founder Recognition Award from Greylock Partners and TechCrunch, finalist for 2019 Edison Award. Through numerous presentations to school PTA, B'zT has been gaining recognitions by parents and teachers. Several schools in Korea has adopted B'zT school system and QM International Art Center, a private school in Flushing, New York adopted the system this year. B'zT's website and Amazon store are showing steady increase in sales.   B'zT is an integration of 100% Cotton t-shirt and 100% biodegradable eco friendly chipset molding. B\u00e2\u0080\u0099zT\u00c2\u00ae Chipset is designed with battery activation button which allows battery power to last up to a year. B\u00e2\u0080\u0099zT's innovative molding material allows B\u00e2\u0080\u0099zT\u00e2\u0080\u0099s intricate electronic circuits to be protected from multiple washes so that from the perspective of parents and children, B'zT feels just like any another t-shirt.   B'zT's technology also provides Field Trip Scanner with which a teacher can monitor up to 30 students during a field trip and School Bus GPS System where parents get not only the location information of the school bus, but also know if their children are all in the bus. With B'zT SCHOOL System, we can protect entire school so that students can learn in a most comfortable environment.   We believe when technology in the backdrop is non-intrusive, we can emphasize the positive means of human connection and provide children the sense of safety, security and confidence.", "Claudia Giselle Design LLC is an award-winning full-service interior design studio.
