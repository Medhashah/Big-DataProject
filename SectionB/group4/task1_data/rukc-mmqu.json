Bus stops will be rehabilitated with expanded ADA-accessible platforms, bus shelters, lighting, and seating. Concrete curb extensions and central medians will be built to reduce crossing distances. Additionally, all the medians along Kings Highway will be reconstructed in a state of good repair along with the bus stops.\"", "The project will provide safer access to parks and recreational spaces along the waterfront, encourage healthy lifestyles by promoting the use of non-motorized forms of transportation, and stimulate economic development by providing connections to employment centers in the Sunset Park, Gowanus, Red Hook and Downtown Brooklyn neighborhoods.
