How do we prepare our children to meet the demands of this ever changing world?  It is clear that they need to become connoisseurs of information.  They must develop the skills to acquire and assess the quality of information that exists in ever increasing amounts.  Technology has become an essential asset for this purpose.  However, technology is expensive to acquire and maintain.  ESMS is committed to providing its students with the requisite skillsets by maintaining and expanding the student access to technology.  Currently, the school has over 200 laptops in 6 carts.  Each classroom has 2 iMacs, a printer, an HDTV and document camera.  Each teacher has their own laptop, which can be also be used to display information on the TVs. The teachers use a lot of digital content in their lessons, and student each have their own Google account.  Schoolwork is done using Google docs, which allows collaboration and paperless submission of student work to the teachers.

Astella will collaborate with the NYC Department of Sanitation, the Coney Island Board of Trade, and Mermaid Ave. merchants to provide these services. Members of the Coney Island Board of Trade, in which Astella helped to revitalize and provides technical assistance, have noted that while most merchants keep the sidewalk area in front of their stores free of liter according to city law, additional liter and sidewalk dirt and stains accumulate throughout the remainder of the day. In addition, according to a survey of Mermaid Ave. merchants conducted by an Astella intern in 2010, cleanliness of Mermaid Ave. was cited as the number one concern among merchants on Mermaid Ave. A cleaner commercial corridor will inspire confidence and pride in the neighborhood, provide a welcoming environment for shoppers, a boost for Mermaid Ave. businesses, and sends the message that a clean neighborhood is important to the community and encourages residents and visitors to Mermaid Ave. not to liter and improve overall cleanliness. Astella will engage the services of a power-washing cleaning company to apply high pressure, hot-water power washers to remove tough dirt, stains, and gum on the sidewalk surfaces along Mermaid Ave. In addition, Astella will initiate a pilot program, hiring three Coney Island residents three times a week from May through November to sweep the sidewalks and street corners, and collect and bag refuse, including cans, bottles, food and food wrappers, newspapers, etc. One of those individuals will also serve as a crew supervisor.

The area encompassed by the Competition will be 60th Street to 125th Street.  The purpose of the program is to generate ideas and build community support for the Esplanade.  When the CB8 Esplanade is connected to the existing greenway south of 34th Street, there will likely be an increase in stakeholders using the continuous waterfront pathway.   Improvements to the CB8 Esplanade will be a long-term project.  A Design Ideas Competition is an important first step. There is a dire need for improved conditions as it is one of few parks in a neighborhood that lacks green space.  CB8 has less than .5 acre per 1,000 residents.  This is below the optimal ratio (2.5 acres per 1,000 residents) in other NYC neighborhoods. With its narrow footprint between FDR Drive and the river, the Esplanade presents a design challenge to maximize the use and enjoyment of this important amenity.   Furthermore, in sections there are limited, difficult to locate or unsafe access points to the Esplanade.  A notable example is the dangerous grade crossing at 96th Street that traverses multiple FDR Drive entry and exit ramps. The competition will include a call for entries to designers, a juried selection process and a public display of entries.  To continue to generate community support, the entries will also be available for review on a website after the display has been removed.  The project will be administered by CIVITAS staff and volunteers. The overall budget of the project is 30,000 and CIVITAS requests 10,000 in funding. This includes: costs of administering the program and publicizing the program via the public display and website."]}], "column_name": "Purpose of Funds ", "number_non_empty_cells": 54460, "number_empty_cells": 0, "number_distinct_values": 11385, "frequent_values": ["None", "Senior Center transportation costs", "To support the local food pantry.", "Immigrant Related Legal Services", "ESL/Civic"]}, {"data_types": [{"type": "TEXT", "count": 54460, "average_length": 4.174458318031583, "shortest_values": ["None", "GALAXY", "Graybeards, Ltd.", "Legal Services NYC", "Safe Horizon, Inc."], "longest_values": ["Bergen Basin Community Development Corporation d/b/a Millennium Development", "Bergen Basin Community Development Corp, d/b/a Millennium Development", "Bay Ridge Bensonhurst Beautification and Preservation Alliance, Inc.", "St. Rosalia-Regina Pacis Neighborhood Improvement Association, Inc.", "Bergen Basin Community Development Corp dba Millennium Development"]}], "column_name": "Fiscal Conduit Name ", "number_non_empty_cells": 54460, "number_empty_cells": 0, "number_distinct_values": 49, "frequent_values": ["None", "St. Rosalia-Regina Pacis Neighborhood Improvement Association, Inc.", "GALAXY", "Maspeth Town Hall, Inc.", "United Activities Unlimited, Inc."]}, {"data_types": [{"type": "INTEGER", "count": 23, "min_value": 112508190, "max_value": 112508190, "mean": 157116115.6956522, "stddev": 58642554.02626232}, {"type": "TEXT", "count": 54437, "average_length": 4.029538732847144, "shortest_values": ["None", "11-1733454", "11-2047151", "11-2300840", "11-2451752"], "longest_values": ["11-1733454", "11-2047151", "11-2300840", "11-2451752", "11-2488439"]}], "column_name": "FC EIN ", "number_non_empty_cells": 54460, "number_empty_cells": 0, "number_distinct_values": 69, "frequent_values": ["None", "11-2697931", "13-2921483", "11-3199040", "11-3233233"]}, {"data_types": [{"type": "INTEGER", "count": 1, "min_value": 11385, "max_value": 11385, "mean": 11385.0, "stddev": 0.0}, {"type": "TEXT", "count": 54459, "average_length": 8.727042362143997, "shortest_values": ["NY", "N/A", "None", "WBHNRC", "111-20A"], "longest_values": ["211 West 145th Street, #4F, New York; Colonial Park Station, P.O.
