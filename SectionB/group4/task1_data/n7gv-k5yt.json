New transfer air ducts are being installed on floors 2, 7 & 8 to assist in the proper function of the return air system. Additional fan coil units are being installed to serve several rooms on the 8th floor & the 7th floor elevator lobby.    ENGINATOR EXHAUST HEAT  This scope involves a means of venting excessive heat that builds up in a shaft way that houses the enginator exhaust pipe that begins in lower level 2 up and out through the roof of the building. The heat emanates through the shaft way walls into the building.  This will be accomplished by installing a new exhaust fan and a makeup air fan that pumps outside air into the shaft way.    CURTAINWALL SHADOW BOX HEAT TRANSFER  Original design created conditions where curtain wall mullions heated to temperatures in excess of 110 F. This scope of works involves installing new metal stud with sheetrock finishes over interior curtain wall mullions. Affected locations are portions of the 2nd floor east side exposure.    WATER PENETRATION THROUGH UNDERGROUND CONDUITS  An existing underground conduit experienced water infiltration which caused those conductors to fail. Those conductors are going to be removed and the conduit abandoned. A new above ground path has been designed for the new feeder.    INTERIOR GLASS REPLACEMENT  Replace 4 sections of glazing at Stair A and 1 section at Stair B.    CONDENSER WATER SYSTEM WITH THREE ROOF TOP DRY COOLERS  Furnish and install a complete new A/C condenser cooling glycol system that includes roof top dry coolers and associated piping. This new system will serve chilled water A/C units in IT closets and elevator machine rooms throughout the building.

Along Woodhaven Boulevard and Cross Bay Boulevard north of 165th Avenue, the project will involve a full roadway reconstruction, excluding the bridges along the corridor, which will only be resurfaced with updated roadway markings. Targeted bus priority measures will also be constructed on Hoffman Drive between Queens Boulevard and Woodhaven Boulevard and on the north side of Queens Boulevard between Woodhaven Boulevard and 57th Avenue. On Woodhaven Boulevard between Queens Boulevard and Rockaway Avenue, this reconstruction will include implementing a multi-lane boulevard design featuring dedicated bus lanes identified with red coloring and overhead signage, as well as new bus stops located along the medians, with new street furniture, ticket vending machines, and pedestrian wayfinding with real time bus arrival information screens. On Cross Bay Boulevard between Rockaway Avenue and 165th Avenue, the reconstruction will include implementing an offset bus lane design featuring dedicated bus lanes identified with red coloring and overhead signage, planted medians, neckdowns, and SBS \"\"bus bulb\"\" stations (extended sidewalks) with ticket vending machines, pedestrian wayfinding with real-time bus arrival information and other street furniture.\"", "\"Introduce Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) treatments along Woodhaven Boulevard and Cross Bay Boulevard north of 165th Avenue in Queens; the project involves a full roadway reconstruction, excluding the bridges along the corridor, which will only be resurfaced with updated roadway markings.

The Southern Brooklyn Crosstown bus route aims to improve bus speeds, reliability, and driver and pedestrian safety along a 10-mile bus route in the Borough of Brooklyn from the Gravesend to Spring Creek neighborhoods. The B82 SBS will be launched in 2018 by NYC DOT and NYCTA. The capital project focuses on the 7.5-mile portion of the entire SBS corridor along Kings Highway (Segment K), Flatlands Avenue (Segment F), and Pennsylvania Avenue (Segment P). Along these three corridors, the capital project will build a combination of new bus lanes with high-quality bus stations and signal timing changes, as well as safety improvements for bus passengers, pedestrians, and all street users. Bus stops will be rehabilitated with expanded ADA-accessible platforms, bus shelters, lighting, and seating. Concrete curb extensions and central medians will be built to reduce crossing distances. Additionally, all the medians along Kings Highway will be reconstructed bringing them to a state of good repair along with the bus stops."]}], "column_name": "Description", "number_non_empty_cells":
