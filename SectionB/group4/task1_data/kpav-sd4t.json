DCP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mission is to plan for the future of New York City. DCP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s six strategic objectives include: (a) to catalyze long-term neighborhood improvement through integrated planning and targeted accompanying public investments; (b) encourage housing production, affordability, and quality; (c) promote economic development and job growth; (d) enhance resiliency and sustainability of neighborhoods; (e) ensure integrity, timeliness and responsiveness in land use reviews; and, (f) supply objective data and expertise to a broad range of planning functions and stakeholders.   Central to its mission, DCP supports the City Planning Commission in its annual review of approximately 450 land use applications. The Department also works closely with OMB in developing the Ten-Year Capital Strategy, and helping manage the $1.0 billion Neighborhood Development Fund, geared toward ensuring growing neighborhoods undergoing rezoning have accompanying infrastructure investments.   THE CAPITAL PLANNING DIVISION We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re working to foster better, more collaborative capital planning through robust data analytics, pro-active interagency coordination, and forward-looking planning for integrated needs of our neighborhoods across all five boroughs.  We are responsible for providing integrated city planning perspectives into the City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s capital budget planning and decision-making processes.  City agencies are planning to invest over $100 billion in New York City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s infrastructure and buildings over the next decade. The Capital Planning team, established in 2014, is working to support strategic capital investment planning across City agencies by boosting the integrated collaboration and coordination across major capital agencies.  Working in partnership with our borough offices, we ensure there is a common, informed set of planning inputs, and a neighborhood-focused lens applied consistently to crucial planning decisions.   Our work spans the lifecycle of capital investment in New York City: \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2\tWe inform capital budget priorities and guiding principles, jointly developing the City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ten-Year Capital Strategy with the Mayor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and evaluating the impact that capital investments can have on neighborhoods and citywide planning priorities with close attention paid to growth and equity. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2\tWe work alongside planners in DCP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s borough offices, strategic planning divisions, and the City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s capital agencies to shape specific projects in dynamic NYC neighborhoods, managing a $1+ billion Neighborhood Development Fund that is dedicated to projects that complement neighborhood rezonings. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2\tWe partner with major capital agencies to ensure they have the robust set of forward-looking planning inputs they need to build capital programs that meet all neighborhood needs of tomorrow. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2\tWe help assess and plan the City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s needs for service and operational facilities in the medium-term, seeking opportunities to take advantage of the broader City portfolio and supportive private investment.  \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2\tWe foster the use of modern technology tools to inform integrated capital planning decisions, evolving intuitive web applications like the NYC Facilities Explorer and Capital Planning Platform and their underlying data products to promote transparency and widespread collaboration in the capital planning process.  THE ROLE The Director of Capital Planning is responsible for helping integrate relevant planning perspectives into the City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s capital budget planning and related decision-making processes.

About the New York City Board of Correction The New York City Board of Correction (BOC) is a nine-person, non-judicial oversight board, which regulates, monitors, and inspects the correctional facilities of the City. Established in 1957, BOC is one of the earliest independent oversight boards of custodial and detention settings in the United States. The Mayor, City Council and presiding justices of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court for the First and Second Judicial Departments (in joint nomination with the Mayor) appoint its members. The City Charter mandates the Board\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s five functions: \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2\tEstablish and ensure compliance with minimum standards for the care, custody, correction, treatment, supervision, and discipline of all persons held or confined under the jurisdiction of the Department of Correction; \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2\tInvestigate serious incidents; \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2\tReview grievances from inmates and staff; \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2\tEvaluate the performance of the Department of Correction; and, \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2\tMake recommendations on areas of key correctional planning.  The Board established the Minimum Standards on jail conditions in 1979, on mental health care in 1985, and on health care in 1991. In 2007, BOC finished a comprehensive review of the Minimum Standards and adopted a series of amendments. In 2015-2016, the Board promulgated rules codifying ground-breaking criminal justice reforms. This included the City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ending of punitive segregation for 16-21 year olds and individuals with serious physical/mental health disabilities. In late 2016, the Board enacted a new chapter of its Minimum Standards that are based on national standards underlying the federal Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA). These new rules require action which is specifically tailored to detecting, preventing and responding to sexual abuse and sexual harassment in the City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jails. Recently, BOC commenced rulemaking on restrictive housing and going forward, will update its Mental Health Minimum Standards.  Over the past two years, to expand its research, monitoring and rule-making efforts, the Board has nearly doubled its annual budget to $ 3 million and its staff to 28 (with planned expansion to 36). With offices in lower Manhattan and Rikers Island, BOC works regularly with the Department of Correction and Health + Hospitals, and often with other government and   external partners, on a wide variety of criminal justice issues germane to its oversight responsibilities. The Board brings to this work a strong emphasis on data-sharing, data-driven decision making and public reporting. In keeping with major reforms occurring at the national, state and local level, the Board recently re-envisioned its mission: to carry out independent oversight and enact regulation in support of safer, fairer, smaller and more humane jails.", "The New York City Board of Correction (BOC) is a nine-person, non-judicial oversight board, which regulates, monitors, and inspects the correctional facilities of the City.
