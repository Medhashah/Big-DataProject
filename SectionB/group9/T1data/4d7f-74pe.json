Through the program, children gather pennies, make grants and take action to help people and causes that matter to them.  Annually, NYC children make hundreds of thousands of dollars in grants to protect the young and the elderly, support disaster relief and fight disease and defend the environment and human rights.   As children progress through the program, they learn to be responsible citizens, philanthropists and community organizers and leaders.  1) Gathering Pennies:  A school-wide, 4 week fall campaign to gather pennies to earn a $1,000 budget for student grant making.  2) Making Grants:  Student leaders, usually 10-15 students across multiple grades, meet weekly for 16 weeks to represent their school in grant making.  They research and discuss community issues with peers, and community members; identify, interview and visit potential grantees; and ultimately, make funding decisions. Students use research, problem solving, teamwork, leadership, and communication skills, and involve the entire student body in their research and decision making.  The $1,000 budget is most often broken into several small grants and service projects (Taking Action). 3) Taking Action: Student leaders organize a volunteer project of their choice, often involving the entire school.  Common Cents staff trains and supports teachers to link service projects with academic lessons, whether it be planting a garden, or planning a community health fair.  We credit our success to the year-round curriculum, training, and support we provide to schools and our commitment to research and innovation.  Common Cents trains an adult facilitator in each school (a Penny Harvest Coach) to work with a group of student leaders to run the year-long program.   We provide over 9 hours of professional development to teachers, as well as on-going assistance via on-site and remote support in order to establish a permanent culture of caring, philanthropy and involvement.  Our annually updated curriculum includes a step by step guide for teachers as well as supplemental lessons and web based content and tools. Lessons are provided across all subject areas and are linked to New York State learning standards and nationally recognized McCrel standards.

Second Stage has formed relationships with a number of junior and senior high schools throughout the five boroughs that consistently utilize this free service for their students.  A majority of participants attend vocational schools, and this program affords them one of very few opportunties to step outside their concentration.  In addition, many of the students\u00e2\u0080\u0099 parents don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have the time, money, and/or inclination to take their children to theater so our matinee series gives them an educational experience they would otherwise not have.  This program not only offers students the chance to see live theatre, it also facilitates a comprehensive discussion between students, their teachers, and our artists regarding the themes and issues that are pervasive in the piece.  All participating classrooms receive a study guide, created and provided by Second Stage Theatre, to assist with this lesson.  These study guides are prepared to help the students think critically about the show.  Following each matinee there is a talk-back session with the cast and creative team that is coordinated by the artistic staff at Second Stage Theatre.  This talk-back gives students the chance to ask questions and interact with the actors, playwrights and directors who helped bring the piece to fruition.  This process makes the play relevant to the students\u00e2\u0080\u0099 lives and puts a personal touch on the experience.  The partipants in the Student Matinee Series live throughout the five boroughs of New York City, range in age from 13-19, and come from diverse socio-economic backgrounds.  The schools we serve include Abraham Lincoln High School (Brooklyn), Baccalaureate School for Global Education (Queens), Cobble Hill High School (Brooklyn), Discovery High School (Bronx), Fashion Industries High School (Manhattan), Graphic Arts High School (Manhattan), Grover Cleveland High School (Queens), Halsey Junior High (Queens), Jacqueline Kennedy-Onassis High School (Manhattan), Washington Irving High School (Manhattan), Urban Academy (Manhattan), West Side High School (Manhattan), Boys and Girls Harbor (Manhattan) and Young Women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Leadership School (Manhattan).  On average, the students from these schools are 14% white, 29% black, 50% Hispanic or Latino, and 7% Asian.  Two-thirds (66%) qualify for free lunches.

We serve an average of 17,000 New York City public school students each year with our residencies, lecture-demonstrations and school shows and expect to serve more in the coming year.
