This scope of works involves installing new metal stud with sheetrock finishes over interior curtain wall mullions. Affected locations are portions of the 2nd floor east side exposure.    WATER PENETRATION THROUGH UNDERGROUND CONDUITS  An existing underground conduit experienced water infiltration which caused those conductors to fail. Those conductors are going to be removed and the conduit abandoned. A new above ground path has been designed for the new feeder.

Along Woodhaven Boulevard and Cross Bay Boulevard north of 165th Avenue, the project will involve a full roadway reconstruction, excluding the bridges along the corridor, which will only be resurfaced with updated roadway markings. Targeted bus priority measures will also be constructed on Hoffman Drive between Queens Boulevard and Woodhaven Boulevard and on the north side of Queens Boulevard between Woodhaven Boulevard and 57th Avenue. On Woodhaven Boulevard between Queens Boulevard and Rockaway Avenue, this reconstruction will include implementing a multi-lane boulevard design featuring dedicated bus lanes identified with red coloring and overhead signage, as well as new bus stops located along the medians, with new street furniture, ticket vending machines, and pedestrian wayfinding with real time bus arrival information screens. On Cross Bay Boulevard between Rockaway Avenue and 165th Avenue, the reconstruction will include implementing an offset bus lane design featuring dedicated bus lanes identified with red coloring and overhead signage, planted medians, neckdowns, and SBS \"\"bus bulb\"\" stations (extended sidewalks) with ticket vending machines, pedestrian wayfinding with real-time bus arrival information and other street furniture.\"", "\"Introduce Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) treatments along Woodhaven Boulevard and Cross Bay Boulevard north of 165th Avenue in Queens; the project involves a full roadway reconstruction, excluding the bridges along the corridor, which will only be resurfaced with updated roadway markings.

Along these three corridors, the capital project will build a combination of new bus lanes with high-quality bus stations and signal timing changes, as well as safety improvements for bus passengers, pedestrians, and all street users. Bus stops will be rehabilitated with expanded ADA-accessible platforms, bus shelters, lighting, and seating. Concrete curb extensions and central medians will be built to reduce crossing distances. Additionally, all the medians along Kings Highway will be reconstructed bringing them to a state of good repair along with the bus stops."], "average_length": 146.51807228915663}]}, {"column_name":
