Further, DOF is not the custodial agency for the majority of the payments collected. We do not have any knowledge of why the payment is being collected, the calculations used to arrive at those payment amounts, any penalties assessed, miscellaneous fees, etc. This data comes from the system of record for these payments, not CPRR. For example, STARS is the system of record for parking summons fees. CPRR is responsible for collecting the payment, but has no understanding of the underlying data attached to that payment. STARS data regarding the payment is already distilled and provided within our parking data sets currently on the OD portal. In the alternative, lets say a request is received by DOF regarding elevator charges attached to a property tax bill. DOF is unable to provide any knowledge or understanding as to the nature of that charge. We are only provided with the amount owed by the charging agency.
