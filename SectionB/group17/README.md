# Big-Data-Project
There are two folders for 2 tasks. 
Task 1 is dealing with datas from NYCOpenData. task1.py is the code for implement. And the output is a json file named task1.json containing information for every column in each dataset.
In task 2, we establish a model to predict the semantic types of the columns based on specific format or words, compare the predicted types with the true types manually labelled and calculate the accuracy of model based on the precision and recall of each semantic type. And output is named as task2.json.

The HDFS directory of the results is /user/xg812/2019-BigDataResults/
