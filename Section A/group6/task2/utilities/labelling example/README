instructions to labelling data:
1. the "2bmr-jdsv_DBA.out" is the original data that is grouped by value name, look through it please
2. you can merge part-00000 and part-00001 together into one file and load it into python or database to do labelling(do this whichever way you want)
3. generate labelling result and store it in the "2bmr-jdsv_DBA.txt" file
4. the format should look like the same in the txt file for the script to read it and store it into the json file
5. the "2bmr-jdsv_DBA.txt" is only a sample,not the actual thing. the sematics labels are in the pdf
6. the output files should be put in the "labelled" folder 
7. use the label.py for quicker output, you might need to change the directories
