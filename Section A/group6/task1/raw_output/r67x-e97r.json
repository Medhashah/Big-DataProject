Not all datasets published in OpenData come with geospatial information. In fact, not all development teams if any are trained to include exactly what is in LL108. If this was a problem, the Open Data team would have stopped publishing any dataset and required us to make remediation steps before publishing as they are the gatekeepers and we need to adhere to certain standards. Knowing this now, I will know better going forward since we have the capability now as well. To address the present problem specific to this set, it seems clear that the requester is asking for house numbers and street numbers to be split so the dataset can be geocoded either on our side or their side. The desktop geocoder is available for the public from DCP to use, so they would need to run the dataset through that if they wanted everything. Because the law doesn\u2019t say which reference data other than Community District, the vagueness does not help guide us to what else is needed other than having the requester self-service the rest through the desktop geocoder. It not that it isn\u2019t available, it just won\u2019t be easy to get \u2018the rest\u2019 of whatever the requester is seeking. So we would need the house number and street name split for us to geocode it and it is work I would assist you putting in an intake to secure this as a project enhancement. This would be the prime opportunity, if you want to proceed, to add more fields that DOI may need (e.g. case type, number of Order to show cause). I would suggest the public request revision of LL108 to be more specific on what kind of geospatial reference data. As far as I know, the address is a valid piece of information that is technically geospatial reference data already without more specifics on the definition.

We are interested in de-duplicating the dataset to measure aggregate evictions throughout the five boroughs, and there are a number of observations that have a) identical index & docket numbers or b) identical marshal name, address, date, and unit number. Do either the former or the latter indicate duplicate observations? In the former situation, it would make sense that a unique index & docket combination would refer to a unique eviction, as the index # seems to be a unique ID provided by NY Housing Court, and docket # seems to be a unique ID assigned by the marshal. However, there are cases of duplicate index & docket combination assigned to different eviction addresses, unit #s, etc. In the latter situation, we are not sure whether we can rule out the possibility of these duplicates referring to, for example, same-day evictions in different units in the same building (where a marshal might have just recorded one unit # for ease).

Not too long ago, the total number of rows in the '311 Service Requests 2010 to present' data set dropped dramatically from about 17 million to 9 million. Why did this happen and is there any way to access the calls that are now missing? For example, on 8/14/11 this data set used to have record of 691 calls with one of these descriptors: sewer backup, catch basin clogged, street flooding, manhole overflow, highway flooding. Today that same data set with the same filters is showing 44 total calls. I had downloaded this data a few months ago so I have all the records for this day that are missing but as I continue my work I will need to download more of this data and thus need to make sure the calls I am downloading are an accurate depiction of the needs of citizens on a given day. Please let me know why this change was made and if there is any way to recover the records as they appeared before the change.
