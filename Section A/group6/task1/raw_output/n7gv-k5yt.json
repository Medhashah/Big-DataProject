The B82 SBS will be launched in 2018 by NYC DOT and NYCTA. The capital project focuses on the 7.5-mile portion of the entire SBS corridor along Kings Highway (Segment K), Flatlands Avenue (Segment F), and Pennsylvania Avenue (Segment P). Along these three corridors, the capital project will build a combination of new bus lanes with high-quality bus stations and signal timing changes, as well as safety improvements for bus passengers, pedestrians, and all street users. Bus stops will be rehabilitated with expanded ADA-accessible platforms, bus shelters, lighting, and seating. Concrete curb extensions and central medians will be built to reduce crossing distances.
