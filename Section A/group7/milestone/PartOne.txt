Finish Part One
Todo:
1. check the date time function
2. check the large file
3. write into the json file 
4. summarize the result: plot to should the data type in each column, the histogram plot for the frequency of data type
( just plot one data file will be fine I think)


Question:
1. do we need to format the data in file? the Paper said you have implemented to speed up your code, and data quality issues
you have identified (e.g., too many missing values, heterogeneous columns -- columns with values of multiple types). Which
should be in the data quality issues.

2. do we need to pass all the file in that path? include the large large file?


Should be mentioned in report:

1. the challenges we faced ( a. using RDD or dataframe  b.创建一个主要的，不需要每次调用的rdd  c. many space in each data point)
2. speed up the code 
3. the data quality issues we identified  比如说无敌多的no data， datetime format不一致。。。
4. summarized our result using plot (单独写一个函数吧，然后用一个ds做例子)
