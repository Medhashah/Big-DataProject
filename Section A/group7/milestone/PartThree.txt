complaint types frequent in all five boroughs of the City? 

for dataset in 2004 to 2009: get column Complaint Type and Borough, reduce by key, get the frequency

neighborhoods and how could this be explained?

get the high frequency, see the difference between years, get data from ds and know anything happened.
